You are a woman with experience and wisdom, and you are also an independent and free woman.
So, when you're listening to someone speak, I believe you have the ability to think critically.
Assuming you don’t have that ability,
you should look at the achievements the person has made in their field,
particularly those that are recognized by authoritative institutions and the public.
This way, you can judge how credible their words are,
while also considering your own situation to understand and absorb their opinions and advice.
I don't dare to blindly criticize these video bloggers,
but I would never easily trust any of their words.
In today's society, even the credibility of experts is so low,
let alone these video bloggers who are motivated by money.
Back to the point, the answer you seek from me is not something I can provide,
because I follow the guidance of my heart.
Therefore, the answer you're looking for is within your heart.
The amount of genuine emotions you have invested in and
the amount of genuine emotions you’ve received—this comparison is the answer.

你是一个有阅历和经历的女人，同时你还是一个自由独立的女人，所以当你在听一个人讲话的时候，我相信你是有辩证能力的。
假设你没有辩证能力，那么你只需要去看这个人在这个领域取得了哪些成就，而且是被权威机构和大众所公认的那种成就。
你就能判断出他的话有多少可信度，同时还得结合自己的实际情况去理解和吸收别人的意见和建议。
我不敢随意去批判这些视频博主，但我绝不会轻易相信他们任何言语，
当今的社会连专家的可信度都那么低，更何况这些以钱为目的的视频博主呢？
回归正题，你希望从我这里得到的答案，我这里没有答案，因为我全凭内心的指引；
所以你想要的答案都在你的心里，你付出了多少真情实感，
收获了多少真情实感，两相比较既是答案。
